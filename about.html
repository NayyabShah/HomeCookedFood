        Research finds that people who eat home-cooked meals on a regular basis
        tend to be happier and healthier and consume less sugar and processed
        foods, which can result in higher energy levels and better mental
        health. Eating home-cooked meals five or more days a week is even
        associated with a longer life. <br />
        <br />
        Whether you live on your own or are a busy parent, finding the time and
        energy to prepare home-cooked meals can seem like a daunting task. At
        the end of a hectic day, eating out or ordering in might feel like the
        quickest, easiest option. But convenience and processed food can take a
        significant toll on your mood and health.
